SystemC examples at various levels of abstractions and of different types
A C++ and a simple SystemC exmple are also enclosed. They are good to verify that the C++ and SystemC environments, respectively are functioning, before one gets down to writing more complicated hardware oriented Systemc code. 

From the following books and our own earlier work:
1. A SystemC Primer, by Bhasker,  2nd edition, 2004. These are RTL level examples. First one: Full Adder, driver, and monitor for it. Separated files given into .h and .cpp files, built with a main.cpp file. Debugging was fairly simple. I had a few systemC related mistakes such as '-' instead of an '_', lower case instead of uppercase in certain reserved keywords, etc. To keep the SystemC paths correct, I just used the HellosystemC example as a template. 
2. System Design with SystemC, by Grotker et al., 2002.
3. Our own papers on Concurrency - Ref to be given soon.
