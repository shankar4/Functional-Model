I will summarize some books on SystemC here: System Design with SystemC, Grotker et al., Kluwer, 2002. 

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count), as of 2017, there are 19.2 billion transistors in AMD's Ryzen-based Epyc, fabricated with a 14 nm process and to a chip size of 4 x 192 m<sup>2</sup>.  Compare this to AMD K10 in 2008 at 0.8 billion transistors with a 45 nm process and a chip size of 258 mm<sup>2</sup>. Among FPGAs, Intel's  Stratix 10 has over 30 billion transistors. Complexity is enormous and continues to dramatically increase. It is the job of the engineering design automation (EDA) industry to manage complexity and help companies deliver new systems at a rapid pace. The Time-to-market today hovers around 18 months, with the time-in-market around 1 year, with ever incresing demand for smaller product size, lower power, and higher speed, and integration of analog and other mixed signal systems (such as MEMS, RF, and sensors). 

A modern SOC (system-on-a-chip)  may contain multiple processors (microcontrollers, DSPs, media processors, etc),  on-chip memory, dedicated hardware accelerators, and periperhal controllers, along with complex on-chip communication networks, and a software stack. To specify, design, and implement such complex systems, and incorporate functionality implemented in both hardware and software, a system-level language, quite unlike the HDLs (hardware description languages) of the old, is needed. Such a language **must support**: specification and design at various levels of abstraction, Incorporation of embedded software at both model and implementation level, creation of executable specifications of design intent, creation of executable platform models, fast simulation speed to enable design space exploration, and separation of computation and communication functionality to allow reuse of both models and implementations.
