[O'Hara et al.](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002530), (2016) have developed a biologist friendly pathway modeling language (mEPN) that entry level biology professionals can use to construct and formalize what they know in a form that can be communicated to their peers. This tool and results will be discussed in a separate folder entitled 'Biological Pathway Models.' Here the emphasis is on their underlying tool for dynamic simulations, namely Petri Nets. I discuss here two papers on porting Petri Nets to SystemC.
