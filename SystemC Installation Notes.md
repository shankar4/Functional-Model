Follow steps here: http://euinovation.blogspot.com/2016/02/systemc-development-of-eclipse-on-linux.html , but modified for installation of SystemC-2.3.2 from [here](http://www.accellera.org/images/downloads/standards/systemc/systemc-2.3.2.zip)

Copy/move the systemc2.3.2.tgz from the download directory to the home directory. Extract/untar with a right click on the folder. A new folder with the same name is created in the home directory (in my case, it is /usr/shankar).

>sudo apt-get upgrade \
.. it recommends: sudo apt autoremove – done.
        There was an error message: Please install the linux-headers-4.4.0-98-generic package…. Then this: Error!  The dkms.conf for this module includes a BUILD_EXCLUSIVE directive which does not match this kernel/arch.  This indicates that it should not be built….. Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-4.15.0-34-generic
Found initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-4.15.0-34-generic
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-4.15.0-33-generic
Found initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-4.15.0-33-generic. I suppose there is no error message to be concerned about. 


sudo apt-get install build-essential  - nothing changed
sudo apt-get update –Done

tar -xzvf systemc-2.3.2.tar.gz

cd systemc-2.3.2

sudo mkdir /usr/local/systemc-2.3.2

mkdir objdir
cd objdir

sudo ../configure –prefix=/usr/local/systemc-2.3.2

export CXX=g++

sudo make
sudo make clean
sudo make -j3
sudo make install
export SYSTEMC_HOME=/usr/local/systemc-2.3.2/

//Smart quote are needed: See https://vinaydvd.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/installing-systemc-in-ubuntu/ 

sudo gedit /etc/environment and add:
     SYSTEMC_HOME=”/usr/local/systemc-2.3.2/”
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/systemc-2.3.2/lib-linux64
sudo gedit ~/.bashrc and add:
	SYSTEMC_HOME=”/usr/local/systemc-2.3.2/”
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/systemc-2.3.2/lib-linux64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
-------------------
This is a copy of the backup notes. NEED TO KEEP WHAT IS RELEVANT
The untarred SystemC folder will be in the home directory. Follow the 'install' file. Works fine till the gmake step. There is no gmake on this system. Now, I will follow the steps at the URL above (i.e., sudo make etc). Worked OK. Now, I am switching back to the install step and do a check: sudo make check - This will compile and run the examples in the subdirectory examples. It passed all the 11 tests

Then, back to URL steps:

    sudo make clean
    sudo make -j3

Next to do: sudo make install in this directory: ~/systemc-2.3.1/objdir 8/10/2018 (continued):

    sudo make install

Tutorials use /usr/local path. I installed in my home directory - redo soon!
So, had to replce /usr/local with /home/shankar, in a few steps below.
I fixed the paths within Eclipse, as given below and the C++ code works.

Export

    export SYSTEMC_HOME=/usr/local/systemc-2.3.1/
    sudo gedit /etc/environment

#and add lines below

    SYSTEMC_HOME="/usr/local/systemc-2.3.1/"
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/systemc-2.3.1/lib-linux64

gedit accepted these lines, but had some error messages, such as "gedit-encoding not supported".
From forums, it appears that these are harmless.
To avoid this problem, use nano or vi, if from command line; else, open gedit from the launcher.
another possibility is leafpad for command line execution

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install leafpad

Another suggestion, helpful for Eclipse.

    sudo apt-get install gksu gedit
    gksu gedit /usr/share/applications/eclipse-oxygen.desktop

The gksu and gksudo commands allow you to elevate your permissions when running graphical
applications. More here: http://www.nongnu.org/gksu/

    sudo gedit ~/.bashrc
    #note: the website missed the gedit part in this command

    SYSTEMC_HOME="/usr/local/systemc-2.3.1/"
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/systemc_2.3.1/lib-linux64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Added these at the end of the file. Same gedit error messages. Could not use the launcher
since I could not locate these files!
