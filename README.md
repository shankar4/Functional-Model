# Functional-Model
Use of Verilog HDL to explore Functional modeling
[ModelSim](https://www.altera.com/products/design-software/model---simulation/modelsim-altera-software.html) simulator will be used. The starter edition is free; it supports mixed HDL simulations (VHDL, Verilog, and System Verilog) and can synthesize to FPGAs.
