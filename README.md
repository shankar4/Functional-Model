# Functional-Model
Use of SystemC to explore Functional modeling of biological pathways.
This documents SystemC 2.3.2 installation on Ubuntu V18, with Eclipse 4.8 (Oxygen), JDK8, and GTKviewer (for graphical display of a VCD dump). I have 3 simple C++/RTL examples documented so far. Eventually, there will be many SystemC examples at various levels of system description, from behavioral to lower levels, and mixed level. The intent is to build an executable model for various biological pathways, known and partially known, involved in atherosclerosis progression.
